> booting tendencies are requiring a slight 
>  modification. The OpenSUSE-Only approach no longer fits. After 
>  destroying several instances of Siduction Linux, I 
>  feel that I have settled in to a rhythm. I wanted to
>  have a Debian based OS as well as another flavor. 
>  OpenSUSE is the other side of the coin. For now. I'm still learning.

> I'm going to lean in to hopping rather than settle 
> on one Linux Distrobution. This repo will contain 
>  info that'll hopefully make distro-hopping smoother. 
>  A script to automate the process would probably be 
>  ideal. That may happen in the future. For now, 
>  independent commands fit my flow best.
